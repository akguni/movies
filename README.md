# MOVIES-FOR-FRIENDS
CS50 Webtrack Final Project Website creating personalized lists for movie fans.

On MOVIES-FOR-FRIENDS (MFF) website you can set up an account and make a list of movies you have seen or would like to see, give a personal rating and add them to "best of" if required.

You can also see what other users are adding to their lists, and see the average ratings for a given movie but without identifying and single user or their individual ratings.

This is useful to anyone if they would like to keep track of which movies they have seen and how they liked them, and keep an eye on what they would like to watch next. There is also a social element, thanks to 'pooling' of other users' ratings and lists.
